    <h1>RZB</h1>
	<h2><pre><center>
	She is a flower in a field of weeds,
	A beacon of light in a world of darkness.
	Her beauty radiates from within,
	A fire that burns with passion and grace.
	
	Her voice is soft and gentle,
	A soothing melody that fills my ears.
	Her words are like honey on my tongue,
	Sweet and nourishing to the soul.
	
	But she is a conservative and religious woman,
	Bound by the traditions of her faith.
	She walks a path of righteousness and virtue,
	Guided by the teachings of her God.
	
	I am but a mere mortal,
	A sinner in the eyes of her deity.
	My heart yearns for her,
	But I fear the wrath of her God.
	
	I am torn between desire and devotion,
	Caught in a tug of war between love and faith.
	I want to hold her hand and gaze into her eyes,
	But I fear the consequences of such a union.
	
	Yet still I cannot help but dream,
	Of a future where we can be together.
	I pray that one day she will see me,
	Not as a sinner, but as a soulmate.
	
	Until that day comes, I will wait,
	Patient and hopeful, for the stars to align.
	For in her arms is where I belong,
	And I will do whatever it takes to make her mine.</center>
	</pre>
